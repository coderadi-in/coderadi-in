I'm a software engineer, full-stack web developer, and entrepreneur who loves building products that make an impact.

I specialize in crafting clean, efficient, and scalable solutions — from modern web apps with smooth UI/UX to robust backend systems and even desktop software with custom Python Tkinter. Whether it's launching new side projects, creating developer tools, or refining production-ready interfaces, I bring both technical expertise and a product-first mindset.

### 🎯 What Drives Me
